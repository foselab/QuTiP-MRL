# QuTiP-MRL: A Library for Multiple-Valued Reversible Logic Simulations

This repository is structured as follows:

- `qudit_circuit.py` provides the core functionalities of QuTiP-MRL library, allowing users for the design, simulation, and rendering of quantum circuits; 
- `ascii_gates.py` contains the definition of ASCII representation of each of the gates provided by our library (i.e., the ternary ones);
- `qutrit_matrices.py` defines matrices for ternary logic gates;
- `setup.py` defines the configuration and dependencies for using QuTiP-MRL;
- `examples` contains several examples of usage of the QuTiP-MRL library.
